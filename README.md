The AI-based Emotion detection Web Application allows users to input text and receive sentiment analysis results. The application utilizes Watson NLP (Natural Language Processing) library to analyze the emotion of the provided text. It formats the output to display the emotion labels (e.g., anger, joy, disgust, sadness, fear), its confidence score, and the dominant emotion. The application is deployed as a web application using Flask, ensuring easy accessibility for users. Error handling mechanisms are incorporated to handle unexpected situations gracefully. The project emphasizes code quality through static code analysis.
